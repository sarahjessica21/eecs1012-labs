    <h2>Winnie-the-Pooh <span style="border:2px solid cyan;"> by A. A. Milne </span> </h2>
	<p
    style="border:2px solid grey;"> In the Milne books, Pooh is naive and slow-witted, but he is also friendly, thoughtful and steadfast. Although he and his friends agree that he is "a bear of very little brain," Pooh is occasionally acknowledged to have a clever idea, usually driven by common sense.

        <h2> The Handmaid's Tale <span style="border:2px solid cyan;"> by Margaret Atwood</span> </h2> 
	<p
	style="border:2px solid grey;">	After a staged attack that killed the President of the United States and most of Congress, a radical political group called the "Sons of Jacob" used quasi-Christian ideology to launch a revolution. The United States Constitution was suspended, newspapers were censored, and what was formerly the United States of America was changed into a military dictatorship known as the Republic of Gilead.
