<p>I know EECS1012 is a challenging course, and I need to <b>enagage</b> really well in problem solving activities from first week of classes for every week.</p>
<p>I have been told that if I treat 1012, 1022, 2030, and 2011 each as a 6-credit course, and really learn the underlying concepts and skills, I will enjoy the rest of my CS program. In fact <u>rest of my life! as long as I am in the CS business.</u></p>
<p> I'm excited to learn the many acpects of <u><strong>EECS 1012</strong></u>! I understand that I will have to work hard in this course in order to succeed and I am ready to put in the hours. </p>
